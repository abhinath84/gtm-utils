## How to run `setup` command

### Pre-requisite

To setup uigtm in remote machine, you have to do below pre-requisites:

- Share directory where uigtm projects will store in remote machine with write permission. That folder's share name must be `projects`.

  Example: Remote uigtm project directory: `D:\ptc\uigtm` and shared directory name will be `\\anath2d\projects`.

- Share `HOME` _environment_ variable directory in remote machine with write permission.

  Example: Remote `HOME` _environment_ variable directory: `D:\ptc\HOME` and shared directory name will be `\\anath2d\HOME`.

> NOTE: once uigtm setup in remote machine is done, unshare `HOME` _environment_ variable directory.
